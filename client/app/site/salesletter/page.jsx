            They charge ₦5,000 per month for access to the community and also
            offer a trading course priced at ₦30,000.

            their members purchase the
            <span className="font-semibold pl-1">₦30,000</span> trading course.
          </p>
          <p>Here&apos;s the math:</p>
          <p>₦5,000 x 100 members = ₦500,000 per month</p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s ₦125,000 per week from simply providing signals and
            educational content.
          </p>
          <p>
            This doesn&apos;t even account for referrals! Our system includes an
            inbuilt, automated affiliate program, meaning your community can
            help spread the word and grow your profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let&apos;s say you&apos;re just starting out, with fewer than
            100 members. That&apos;s okay!
          </p>
          <p>
            Some trading academies have thousands of members, but starting small
            is perfectly fine.
          </p>
          <p>For example, in your first month, you get just 10 members.</p>
          <p>₦5,000 x 10 members = ₦50,000 per month</p>
          <p>
            For 12 months, that&apos;s ₦600,000 in annual revenue—
            <span className="text-blue-500">₦52,500 per month</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If even one person purchases your ₦30,000 trading course or
            one-on-one mentorship, that&apos;s another ₦30,000 added to your
            total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this worst-case scenario, you&apos;re already looking at{" "}
            <span className="text-blue-500">₦630,000</span> in annual revenue

            <p>
              This results in additional costs and a huge time investment. They

              leaders and content creators.
            </p>
            <p>Here&apos;s why it works so well:</p>
            <p>
              After working with countless Telegram community owners, I realized
              something crucial:
            </p>
            <p>
              Not everyone has the time to manage every aspect of their
              community full-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many coaches and educators want a simple way to earn money while
              focusing on what they do best—delivering value to their members.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem is, most systems are overly complex and require
              endless hours of manual work.
            </p>
            <p>
              But with <span className="font-bold">GroupShepherd</span>,
              I&apos;ve eliminated all that.

            <p>
              we&apos;ve built a system that automates 90% of the work—leaving
              you to focus on growing your community, engaging your members, and

                One of the biggest advantages of paid community management with
                Group Shepherd is that people already recognize the value of
                being part of exclusive, well-managed groups.
              </p>
              <p>Think about it:</p>
              <p>
                If someone is part of a thriving Telegram group where they gain
                valuable insights, exclusive content, or business opportunities,
                they&apos;re already motivated to stay in that group.
              </p>
              <p>
                The challenge isn&apos;t convincing them to join but ensuring
                they remain part of the group while contributing their fair
                share.
              </p>
              <p>And here&apos;s the best part:</p>
              <p>
                You don&apos;t need to manage group payments manually or chase
                members for subscriptions.
              </p>
              <p>Group Shepherd automates all of that for you.</p>
              <p>
                Let&apos;s compare it to other digital solutions: With typical
                digital products—courses, mentorship, ebooks, etc.—you often
                need to:
              </p>
              <p>Convince people why they need your trading knowledge.</p>
              <p>Prove the value of your specific knowledge.</p>
              <p>Build trust so they feel safe making a purchase.</p>
              <p>
                With Group Shepherd, people already know the value of your
                community. All you need to do is set up the system to ensure
                they pay for access — and let Group Shepherd handle the rest.
