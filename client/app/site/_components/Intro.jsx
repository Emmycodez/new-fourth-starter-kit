              Hey there, I&apos;m Oamen Emmanuel. I am the creator of the Group
              Shepherd software and bot to help manage payment in Telegram
              communities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
              I observed that many online educators, as well as crypto and forex
              traders, were creating large communities on Telegram but had no
              way to manage their payments.
            </p>

          <p>
            They couldn't enforce payment rules and charge subscription payments
            from members of their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially forex and crypto traders who give out free signals in
            their communities, signals which they could easily charge monthly
            subscriptions for.
          </p>
          <p>And so I set out to build a solution to solve this problem.</p>
          <p>
            Group Shepherd isn&apos;t yet available for mass distribution, but we are
            currently building custom solutions and bots for individuals to
            manage their communities.
